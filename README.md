# Blep WaniKani

Track your WaniKani progress and defeat your enemies.

“If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.”
― Sun Tzu, The Art of War

## Tutorial

See [this useful workshop](https://cdkworkshop.com/20-typescript.html) on working with the AWS CDK for Typescript projects.

## Deploying

Then run `yarn build && yarn deploy`.

## Useful commands

- `yarn build` compile typescript to js and create synth stack
- `yarn watch` watch for changes and compile
- `yarn test` perform the jest unit tests
- `yarn cdk deploy` deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
- `yarn cdk diff` compare deployed stack with current state
- `yarn cdk synth` emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
- `yarn lint` lints the project
- `prettier-format` formats the project (Intended to be used only when need. You should configure your IDE/Editor to format each file on save so that you don't need this.)
